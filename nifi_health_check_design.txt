## Design Implementation for NiFi Health Check Function

### 1. Objectives
- Monitor the availability and responsiveness of NiFi.
- Check the status of NiFi components: processors, controller services, and connections.
- Alert if the flow is stuck, back pressure is triggered, or any critical component is invalid/stopped.

---

### 2. Key Components to Monitor
| Component | Health Indicator |
|----------|------------------|
| Web UI / API | 200 OK on `/nifi-api/system-diagnostics` |
| Processors | All in "RUNNING" state |
| Connections | No backpressure / queue overflow |
| Controller Services | All enabled and valid |
| Disk Space | No low disk space alerts |
| JVM Memory | Within healthy thresholds |

---

### 3. Health Check Endpoint
Use NiFi's **REST API** for monitoring:
- `/nifi-api/system-diagnostics`
- `/nifi-api/flow/status`
- `/nifi-api/process-groups/root/status`

#### Sample Request:
```bash
GET http://<nifi-host>:8080/nifi-api/system-diagnostics
```

#### Sample Response Fields to Check:
```json
{
  "systemDiagnostics": {
    "aggregateSnapshot": {
      "freeHeap": "2.5 GB",
      "heapUtilization": "60%",
      "flowFileRepositoryStorageUsage": "30%",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 4. Implementation Strategy

#### a. Create a Script or Service
- Write a script (Python, Bash, or Java) to call the NiFi REST API.
- Parse the response and determine if key metrics are within thresholds.
- Output a status code and message.

#### b. Integrate with Monitoring Tool
- Use tools like **Prometheus + Grafana**, **Nagios**, or **Elastic Stack**.
- Optionally, expose your health check as an internal HTTP service for Kubernetes or load balancer probes.

#### c. Return Unified Health Status
Example JSON output from your custom health checker:
```json
{
  "nifi_status": "healthy",
  "heap_utilization": "60%",
  "disk_usage": "70%",
  "backpressure": false,
  "processors": {
    "running": 120,
    "stopped": 0,
    "invalid": 0
  }
}
```

---

### 5. Security Consideration
- Secure API calls using NiFi user authentication and HTTPS.
- Only allow internal access to health check service.

---

### 6. Schedule and Alerting
- Run every 1â€“5 minutes via a cron job or a monitoring system.
- Send alerts (e.g., email, Slack) if:
  - Heap usage > 85%
  - Disk space < 10%
  - Any processor is invalid/stopped
  - API is unresponsive

---

### 7. Documentation
- Include how the health check works, the thresholds used, how to run it manually, and how to integrate it into CI/CD or Kubernetes readiness/liveness probes.
