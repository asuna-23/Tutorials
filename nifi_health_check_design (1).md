## General Health Check Function Design Implementation

### 1. Define the Purpose
Clarify what you want the health check to monitor:
- Is the system responsive?
- Are key components functioning correctly?
- Are there resource usage issues?

### 2. Identify System Components to Monitor
Common elements:
- Uptime / availability
- CPU/memory/disk usage
- Database or external service connectivity
- Application-specific logic (e.g., processing queues, thread counts)

### 3. Choose Health Indicators
Define what makes each component “healthy”. For example:
- CPU < 80%
- Memory usage < 75%
- Database responds to a ping in < 500ms

### 4. Define Health States
- **Healthy**: Everything is working as expected.
- **Degraded**: Some non-critical issues are occurring.
- **Unhealthy**: Critical issues preventing normal operations.

### 5. Design a Health Check Function
- Implement a function or endpoint that returns system status.
- Return a simple structure (e.g., JSON) with component-wise status.
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "components": {
    "database": "healthy",
    "memory": "degraded",
    "cpu": "healthy"
  }
}
```

### 6. Expose the Health Check
- Create an internal HTTP endpoint like `/health` or `/status`
- This endpoint can be used by:
  - Load balancers
  - Monitoring tools
  - Orchestration systems (e.g., Kubernetes probes)

### 7. Set Up Monitoring and Alerts
- Integrate with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios, or custom dashboards.
- Define alert thresholds and actions.

### 8. Document Everything
Include:
- What is being checked
- How often it's checked
- Thresholds for healthy/degraded/unhealthy
- How to test and update it



## Design Implementation for NiFi Health Check Function

### 1. Objectives
- Monitor the availability and responsiveness of NiFi.
- Check the status of NiFi components: processors, controller services, and connections.
- Alert if the flow is stuck, back pressure is triggered, or any critical component is invalid/stopped.

---

### 2. Key Components to Monitor
| Component | Health Indicator |
|----------|------------------|
| Web UI / API | 200 OK on `/nifi-api/system-diagnostics` |
| Processors | All in "RUNNING" state |
| Connections | No backpressure / queue overflow |
| Controller Services | All enabled and valid |
| Disk Space | No low disk space alerts |
| JVM Memory | Within healthy thresholds |

---

### 3. Health Check Endpoint
Use NiFi's **REST API** for monitoring:
- `/nifi-api/system-diagnostics`
- `/nifi-api/flow/status`
- `/nifi-api/process-groups/root/status`

#### Sample Request:
```bash
GET http://<nifi-host>:8080/nifi-api/system-diagnostics
```

#### Sample Response Fields to Check:
```json
{
  "systemDiagnostics": {
    "aggregateSnapshot": {
      "freeHeap": "2.5 GB",
      "heapUtilization": "60%",
      "flowFileRepositoryStorageUsage": "30%",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 4. Implementation Strategy

#### a. Create a Script or Service
- Write a script (Python, Bash, or Java) to call the NiFi REST API.
- Parse the response and determine if key metrics are within thresholds.
- Output a status code and message.

#### b. Integrate with Monitoring Tool
- Use tools like **Prometheus + Grafana**, **Nagios**, or **Elastic Stack**.
- Optionally, expose your health check as an internal HTTP service for Kubernetes or load balancer probes.

#### c. Return Unified Health Status
Example JSON output from your custom health checker:
```json
{
  "nifi_status": "healthy",
  "heap_utilization": "60%",
  "disk_usage": "70%",
  "backpressure": false,
  "processors": {
    "running": 120,
    "stopped": 0,
    "invalid": 0
  }
}
```

---

### 5. Security Consideration
- Secure API calls using NiFi user authentication and HTTPS.
- Only allow internal access to health check service.

---

### 6. Schedule and Alerting
- Run every 1–5 minutes via a cron job or a monitoring system.
- Send alerts (e.g., email, Slack) if:
  - Heap usage > 85%
  - Disk space < 10%
  - Any processor is invalid/stopped
  - API is unresponsive

---

### 7. Documentation
- Include how the health check works, the thresholds used, how to run it manually, and how to integrate it into CI/CD or Kubernetes readiness/liveness probes.
